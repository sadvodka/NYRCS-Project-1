we are the 3 sigma boys from NYJC
We are making a game via python (pygame) which is essentially a maze where the player has to battle and defeat various monsters (entities) and make it to the end.

1 Get maze graphics down (draw out the walls, obstacles within the game)
 2 Player mechanics (basic player visualisation (square), player movement mechanics, interactions with wall etc)
 3 Entities (this might require OOP :( )
 4 Aesthetics: Assets, music, background
 5 Additional upgrades: Once done with first maze, move on to second “level”? Boss fight? The target is to do one game “level” similar to like a campaign story. Add dialogue
